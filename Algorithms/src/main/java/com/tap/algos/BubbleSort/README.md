### Overview

> Simple sorting algorithm with O(n^2) complexity.

### Algorithm explanation:

> BubbleSort uses two enhanced for loops to iterate over data.
> With the 'i' in the first for loop we access the element with which we
> will compare the rest of the elements. With 'j' from the inner for loop
> we are accessing the element to be compared to. If the element at index 'i'
> is greater than the element at index 'j' we swap their places. This process
> will continue until we have traversed the array with the outer for loop.

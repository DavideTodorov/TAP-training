### Overview

> A simple sorting algorithm with O(n^2) complexity.

### Algorithm explanation

> Selection sort algorithm uses two enhanced for loops. From the outer one
> we get the element on index 'i' which we consider to be the minimum element.
> With the second for loop we iterate all the elements on the right of
> index 'i' and find the true minimum element and after that we swap their
> places. Everything on the left of index 'i' is considered sorted and
> everything on the right is considered unsorted.

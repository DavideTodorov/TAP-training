### Overview

> Simple sorting algorithm with O(n^2) complexity.

### Algorithm explanation

> Insertion sort uses two enhanced for loops to iterate over all elements.
> From the outer for loop from index 'i' we get the current element with which
> we will check the already sorted data. We assume the elements to the left
> of index 'i' as sorted. We have inner for loop which is traversing from
> index 'i' until it reaches 0. If the element at index 'j'
> ('j' is from the inner for loop) is bigger than the element at
> index 'i' we swap their places.

# Design Principles and Patterns Lab

This is a simple program that mimics file upload to AWS. Your goal is to refactor it, apply design principles and patterns
to support upload to multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, etc.).
Imagine that someone else will maintain this code in the future, try your best to make their life easier :blush:

The program will have 3 main functions: Validate parameters, get content type of the input file and upload it.
You don't have to implement to upload function, just print a line in console.

There are 2 parameters in this program, first is cloud provider, second is name of the file.
